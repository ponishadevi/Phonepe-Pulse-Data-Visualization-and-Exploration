Project Objectives

1.Data Extraction:
Scripting to clone the repository and collect data

2.Data Transformation:
Use Python and Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Handle missing values and clean the data.

3.Database Insertion:
Connect to a MySQL database using mysql-connector-python.
Insert transformed data into the database.

4.Dashboard Creation:
Utilize Streamlit and Plotly for building an interactive dashboard.
Implement a variety of visualizations for better insights.

5. Data Retrieval:
Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard


Approach:
